# Algorithms-Implementations
Collection of simple algorithms and data structures I've implemented on laboratory classes.
## List of projects and their properties:
### Hashtables
Count the number of occurences of each word in the text given in the input. Store these numbers in a hash table: the word should be interpreted as a key (type string), and the number of occurences as a value (type int). Use the method of collision resolving suggested by the teacher.
You can use an array of fixed, constant size, but allocate it dynamically! The maximum number of elements in a test is 100000. Choose the appropriate size of the array.
Input:
The text (any number of words with only lower case letters, separated by spaces or new line characters). The words starting with character '?' and '-' should be interpreted as commands:
- '?': print the number of occurences of the given word on the screen,
- '-': remove the information about the given word from your hash table (from this point you should start counting the occurences of this word from 0),
- 'q': exit.
### BST
Implement a binary search tree (BST). Each element of a tree should have a key (unsigned integer).
Your program should support the following operations:
- + - add a new element with a given key to the tree,
- - - remove an element with a given key from the tree (ignore this operation if there is no such an element in the tree),
- ? - search the tree for an element with a given key, write '1' if the element was found, or '0' if not,
- m - write the key of the minimum element in the tree,
- M - write the key of the maximum element in the tree,
- q - quit the program.
