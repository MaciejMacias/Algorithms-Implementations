# Algorithms-Implementations
Collection of algorithms and data structures I've implemented on laboratory classes.
## List of projects and their properties:
### Hashtables
Count the number of occurences of each word in the text given in the input. Store these numbers in a hash table: the word should be interpreted as a key (type string), and the number of occurences as a value (type int). Use the method of collision resolving suggested by the teacher.
You can use an array of fixed, constant size, but allocate it dynamically! The maximum number of elements in a test is 100000. Choose the appropriate size of the array.
Input:
The text (any number of words with only lower case letters, separated by spaces or new line characters). The words starting with character '?' and '-' should be interpreted as commands:
- '?': print the number of occurences of the given word on the screen,
- '-': remove the information about the given word from your hash table (from this point you should start counting the occurences of this word from 0),
- 'q': exit.
